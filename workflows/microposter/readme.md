### What does it do?

Quickly post to Micro.blog from Alfred. Include categories using hastags e.g. `mb My great post about a book #books`.

1. Install the workflow
2. Get an API from Micro.blog [https://micro.blog/account/apps](https://micro.blog/account/apps)
3. Add the key to `api_key` in environment variables for the workflow
4. Add your domain under `site` in the environment variables for the workflow

Keyword is `mb`

Currently this will not handle categories with spaces in them.
